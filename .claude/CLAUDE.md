## authorized edits:
1. always ask when need to do rm -f for any files/folders.

## Documentation: All saved in "docs/"
### README.md
1. Only have one README.md under the root (repo).
2. README.md shows the overview of this project.
2. Modify as needed to describe the in-use components of this repo, up-to-date.

### Other documentation
1. for each fix, will record all in one MD file "docs/FIX_Database_Docs.md".
2. for each claude session/edition, don't generate extra solo md files. Record everything in "docs/RECORD_Change.md".
3. For all new markdown files, first check if can combine with existed MD files in "docs/". If not, create and save only in "docs/".
4. For all documentation. Keep words precise. Each addition of record will add a one-sentence index indicated with edit time.
5. Documentation should be clear and less redundant that minimizes repeated contents.
6. Everytime a new change happened, add a new date and new index to precisely describe the change. To avoid redundantness, if modified on previous change (like discarded old changes), simply refer to previous index and shorten previous change contents with less details.
